[`dj-system-monitor`](https://github.com/lazarus-org/dj-system-monitor/) is a Django package developed by Lazarus to monitor system resources efficiently. It provides a `ResourceUsage` model to store Usage metrics, a Django `ModelAdmin` for easy management via the admin panel, and a built-in Dashboard using template view for live monitoring. Additionally, it offers a Django REST Framework (DRF) API for tracking Resource Usages at the API level.

This package is designed to be flexible and easy to integrate into Django projects, allowing developers to track system resource usages effectively. Whether you need a simple dashboard or a full-fledged API, `dj-system-monitor` provides the necessary tools to streamline system monitoring.
